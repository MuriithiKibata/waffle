This Project was done by Muriithi Kibata.

Thank God the CSS and HTML where fairly easily. What seriously delayed me by two days was the API.
At first I wanted it to render the images onto my page, but all the images on my API were giving me error 404. To further complicate matters I was unable to find another API to suit my purposes, and Rabid API only allows a certain number of API calls per day.  As such, I had to then use the API to render reviews of places. But thank God I still managed.
The 3 event listeners were DOMContentLoaded, Click/alert, and dbclick for fullscreen.
For interactivity, I added a like button that increments, would have added more but time isn't on my side. Redirects aren't allowed so the "Book Now" buttons do not actually take you anywhere.

The purpose of the app was to recommend tour locations to tourists.
